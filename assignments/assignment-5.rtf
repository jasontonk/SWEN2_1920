Write or copy a couple of paragraphs of text that answer the following question :

When a branch is reviewed and merged into another branch (eg. dev or main), the code should be tested. After this what should happen with the branch that contained the feature?

After the merge, it's safe to delete the branch:
Additionally, git will warn you (and refuse to delete the branch) if it thinks you didn't fully merge it yet. If you forcefully delete a branch (with git branch -D) which is not completely merged yet, you have to do some tricks to get the unmerged commits back though (see below).
There are some reasons to keep a branch around though. For example, if it's a feature branch, you may want to be able to do bugfixes on that feature still inside that branch.
If you also want to delete the branch on a remote host, you can do:
This will forcefully delete the branch on the remote (this will not affect already checked-out repositiories though and won't prevent anyone with push access to re-push/create it).
